## Paducah KY Training
Below are some training topics for executive secretaries. 

### How To Stay Organized
- Write things down, whether by pencil or by phone. `"The dullest pencil is better than the sharpest memory."`
- Use a shared calendar (digital if you can). Put the appointments on a calendar and set notifications so 
    - Digital (online) calendars are free (Google, Outlook, etc)
- If you have a lot of projects, initiatives, appointments, etc, use an organizational tool like Trello or Microsoft Planner. 

### How To Initiate Contact
- Try to say hello in person before going to digital text messages, or email. Then you can go digital after meeting in person. 
- Start with `Hi` or `Hello`. 
- Say something genuine to break the ice. Don't go right into asking for what you need. 
    - `"How is your family?"`
    - `"I saw your son, Z, hit a good basket the bastketball game on Saturday..."` 
- A few examples: 
    - `"Hi, Sister X, hope you're well."`
    - `"Hi, Brother Y, it was good to see you at church... "` 

### What To Say To Be Welcoming
- Say hello at church (without asking for anything)
- Give before you ask. Ex: `"I remember your coconut pie at the pot lock was sooo good!"`

### What ToDdo (and not do) When a Member Stops Responding
- Don't keep trying the same way. Ex text or call them. This might be seen as badgering or annoying. 
- Try a different way of contacting the person. Go from text to email, or phone call to in-person. 


## Conclusion
By following these tips, you will be a more effective executive secretary to reach people and help them progress toward their next ordinance.
