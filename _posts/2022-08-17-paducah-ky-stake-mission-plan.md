> *Updated: Feb 20, 2026. Added detail to sacrament meeting

In the Paducah Kentucky stake, we will:

### Empower the member/missionary coordination meeting:
- Have the right people at the coordination meeting:
EQ/RS/Pri presidency counselor assigned to missionary work, Youth (YM/YW) assigned to missionary work, Ward/Branch Mission Leader (if called), Full time missionaries, Ward/branch Missionaries
- Use an agenda
- Use effective communication:
Notify Ward/Branch council of people to meet the Bishop, needed callings/ministering assignments, needed priesthood
- Review the covenant path report (previously called the new and returning member progress report)
- EQ/RS presidents submit a weekly return and report that includes a focus on new members
- Full-time missionaries submit a weekly member/missionary participation report
- The Stake presidency provides training

### Help Units have effective huddle meetings
- Background information: Huddle meetings are short meetings held to coordinate who will minister to those not present at church. See [Weekly Coordination Meetings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/my-home/areas/usa-southeast/weekly-coordination-meetings?lang=eng) for more details
- Stake leadership will provide training and follow-up for huddle meetings

### Make sacrament meeting a welcoming place
- 5-10 mins before sacrament meeting, a bishopric/branch presidency member invites the congregration to reverently prepare for the sacrament
- Ward/Branch members make friends and visitors feel loved and welcomed

### Invite members to participate in half the appointments with missionaries (50% participation rate)
- Missionaries to invite members to share their testimonies of Christ with friends
