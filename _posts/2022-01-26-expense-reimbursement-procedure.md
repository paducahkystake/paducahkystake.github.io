In your calling, you may spend money for activities or other items. Follow this procedure to get reimbursed.

## Before You Spend
1. Be aware of the funds in your assigned stake budget. If you have questions, please contact the stake clerk. He can give you the amount of your budget allocation, expenses and remaining balance.

2. Stay within budget if at all possible. Be considerate as these are sacred funds but know it’s for a good cause: to bring souls to Christ. Information on the Stake Budget can be found in the General Handbook of Instructions Section [34.6.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/34-finances-and-audits?lang=eng#title_number21)

3. If you anticipate the expense will take you over your assigned budget, please contact the stake clerk with your needs and he will present your request to the stake president. Do not hesitate to do this; most reasonable requests will be approved.

## After You Spend
1. Fill out and submit the Paducah Kentucky Stake [Reimbursement Request form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qXSMESMttNnIKe8smS1AcSGsx7avcSh/view?usp=sharing) along with any receipts to the stake clerk (it may be advisable to copy your priesthood leader). This can be done via email or hard copy (email is preferred). Please note — if you submit an email the best method is to scan the document(s) and attach them to your email. Using your phone to take a photo and then attaching them to an email WILL NOT work with all phones. The stake clerk may contact you and ask you to re-send the documents in a different format. If your documents are not in the right format, your reimbursement will be delayed.

2. Reimbursements will not be processed without the current version of the [Stake Reimbursement Request form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qXSMESMttNnIKe8smS1AcSGsx7avcSh/view?usp=sharing) (dated 1 January 2022). If you do not have a form, please ask the stake clerk to send you one (make as many copies as you need).

3. The preferred method to receive reimbursements is through an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). This will allow your request to be reviewed, processed and approved in the shortest amount of time. If you do not make donations online, you will need to set up an EFT account. Contact the stake clerk for assistance. If you do make donations online, the EFT account for reimbursement is easy to activate. Again, contact the stake clerk for assistance.

4. If you prefer to receive reimbursements with a check, be prepared to wait. The time interval between your submission of a request and receipt of your check may take a few weeks as the stake clerk does not live near the stake center.

5. The stake clerk will typically send you a note to inform you that your reimbursement is being processed.
