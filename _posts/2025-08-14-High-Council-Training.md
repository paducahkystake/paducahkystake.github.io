> Hi Bro ___,

> Welcome to the stake High Council! The Stake Presidency may provide you additional training but I wanted to share some information with you.

> Here are some useful links about being a High Councilor in our stake from the stake's leadership blog. Your primary instruction is from the handbook but these links provide some stake-specific information.

> Email is the primary means the stake presidency communicates with the high Council so you will see emails from me or the stake presidency from time to time.

> Take care and please let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to working with you!
