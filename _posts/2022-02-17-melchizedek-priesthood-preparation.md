> Helping prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood is one of the quorum presidency’s highest priorities. — HB 8.4

Follow the procedure below to prepare a prospective elder to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.

## Prepare
The Elders Quorum president oversees the preparation phase. He either works directly with the prospective elder or delegates the preparation to one of his counselors or another brother.

1. Follow the instructions in the [church handbook section 8.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng#title_number118).

2. Ensure the person gains experience exercising the Aaronic priesthood.

3. Worthiness: Review the “[Melchizedek Priesthood Ordination Record](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/records/ordinances/priesthood?lang=eng)” interview questions with the brother so he is aware of the requirements and can prepare spiritually as needed. Print a blank form from LCR.

## Interview
The Bishop/Branch president oversees the interview phase.

1. The Bishop/Branch president counsels with the Stake President, who may ask for additional preparation as inspired by the Spirit. In the case of a youth, they may also consider the instructions in handbook [18.10.1.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng#title_number60).

2. When the person is ready, the Bishop/Branch President requests the Stake President’s permission to interview the person.

3. With the Stake President’s approval, the Bishop/BP interviews the brother and submits the [Melchizedek priesthood ordination form](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/records/ordinances/priesthood?lang=eng) (recommendation) in LCR, which sends a notification to the Stake President and Executive Secretary.

4. The Executive Secretary sends the request for a High Council vote

5. The Executive Secretary schedules an interview with the person and a member of the stake presidency

6. A member of the stake presidency interviews the brother

## Ordination
The Stake Presidency oversees the ordination, typically delegated to a High Councilor.

1. The brother is sustained at the next stake conference (or sustained in their local ward/branch and ratified at the next stake conference)

2. The brother is ordained to the Melchizedek priesthood by another worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder. A member of the Stake presidency or a High Councilor will be present to witness the ordination. See [Witnessing a Melchizedek Priesthood Ordination](witnessing-a-melchizedek-priesthood-ordination) for details.

## Reports
The stake clerk oversees the reporting.

1. The stake clerk records the ordination in LCR and prints and distributes a certificate.
