> “Receiving a call to serve should be a meaningful spiritual experience for a member. Callings to serve the Lord are sacred and joyful opportunities. Leaders communicate this by the way they extend a calling.” — HB 30.2

*Updated: Feb 24, 2024. Added details about the spouse’s involvement.*

The Lord calls people to serve. As stake leaders, you may be asked to extend a calling to a member. This article describes that process. For background, you should read [Callings in the Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng#title_number1) in the church handbook.

## Context
Remember that this calling came by inspiration. Treat this assignment and the person with respect, dignity and timeliness.

## General tips 💡
1. Set an appointment beforehand where possible
2. Be on time
3. If the person is married, invite their spouse to join the meeting when you extend the calling. The worthiness portion (instructions covered later in this article) is done alone with the candidate unless they request otherwise. Ask the spouse if he or she supports the calling, then ask the candidate.
4. Make the meeting a spiritual experience
5. Get to know the member a bit before discussing the calling. You may ask about their family, employment, health, etc. Follow the spirit to know what to ask

## Extending the Calling
Study [Extending a Calling](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng#title_number8) in the church handbook (HB 30.2). This is an excellent resource on how to extend a calling. A couple prerequisite items:

1. Verify if the member is available. The handbook states “the authorized leader counsels with the member to understand if the member’s circumstances allow him or her to serve.” You may ask, “Are you available to serve in a calling?” You may find that circumstances prevent the person from serving. Follow the Spirit to know if you should extend the calling. If you feel the person is not available due to circumstances, thank the person for their time and end the meeting.

2. Verify the member is worthy but don’t get into details. The handbook states “The leader also seeks to understand if the member is worthy and willing to serve.” You may ask, “Are you worthy to hold a calling at this time?” If the member says no, encourage them to discuss the details with their bishop as appropriate if they have not already done so. Testify of the Atonement and its power to cleanse and strengthen us and express confidence in the person’s ability and the Lord’s trust in them. Thank the person for their time and end the meeting.

If the member is **willing and worthy**, proceed with explaining about the calling. Encourage the member to ask questions as needed.

At the end, ask the spouse (if present) if they support their spouse receiving this calling. Then ask the member **“Do you accept this calling?”** It’s ok if they need time to think/pray about it and get back to you.

If the member accepts the calling, thank them and explain the next steps of when they will be sustained and set apart, and provided training.

## Return and Report
Report the outcome of your meeting to the person who issued you the assignment.
