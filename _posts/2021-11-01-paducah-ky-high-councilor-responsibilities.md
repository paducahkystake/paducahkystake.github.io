> Under the direction of the stake presidency, high councilors help with the work of salvation and exaltation in the stake. — HB 6.5

*Updated: Feb 23, 2024. Updated 2024 Unit Conference instruction link. Updated useful links*

What are your responsibilities as a High Councilor? According to [section 6.5 in the church handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/6-stake-leadership?lang=eng#title_number19), Stake High councilors have 3 areas of responsibilities:

1. Represent the Stake Presidency
2. Serve on Stake Councils and Committees
3. Serve as Stake Organization Leaders

## Paducah KY specific responsibilities
In addition to the handbook instruction, here are some specific responsibilities for the Paducah KY Stake:

- Attend high council meetings. Typically, twice per month via zoom, you will get a calendar invite sent to your email.
- Monthly speaking assignments. Every month, the stake presidency requests that you speak at an assigned unit on a topic that the stake presidency prayerfully chooses. See [How to Give A High Councilor Talk](how-to-give-a-high-councilor-talk).
- Participate in High Council sustaining votes. Certain callings require High Council approval (see the “Approved by” column in the [chart of callings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng#title_number114)) that are conducted in High Council meetings or via email.
- Check your email. Much of the communication from the stake presidency will come via email. It is important to respond to those emails in a timely manner.
- Email a bi-monthly “return and report” to the stake presidency with an update on your assignments. You will receive an email reminder with a link to an online form to fill out.
- Help your assigned ward/branch prepare for its ward/branch conference. Review the [unit conference instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvzgoQIaraHNgozllLLimfkrPRJKv_9P/view?usp=drive_link) with your assigned ward/branch council at least 1 month prior to the unit conference. Attend your assigned ward/branch conference.

The stake presidency is here to support you in your calling. May the Lord continue to bless you for your diligent efforts.
