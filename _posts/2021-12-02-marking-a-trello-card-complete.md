How do you mark a [Trello](https://www.trello.com/) card `complete`? This article shows you the steps to do that.

**Background**: The stake presidency Trello board uses “lists” as the status. So changing status actually means moving the card to a different list.

1. Open the card and near the top where it says “In List” it will show the current list, typically “In Progress”.

2. Click the “In List” link and it will bring up a menu. Choose the “List” dropdown, then choose “Completed”.

3. This will move the card to the Completed list.

Alternatively, you can drag the card from the current list to the “Completed” list.
