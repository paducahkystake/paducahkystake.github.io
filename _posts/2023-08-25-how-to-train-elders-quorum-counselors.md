> The Melchizedek Priesthood helps God’s children prepare to return to His presence. — HB 8.1

*Updated: August 2025. Added Stake Initiatives*

As a High Councilor or Stake Presidency Member, you may be asked to provide training to an Elders Quorum counselor. This article provides suggestions to help with your assignment.

This content was taken from the church handbook chapters [Leadership and Councils in the Church of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title_number1) (4) and [Elders Quorum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng#title_number1) (8).

## Prepare
Before meeting with the person, consider these suggestions.

- Prayerfully consider the person. What needs do they have? What are their family, work, and personal circumstances and how will that change the way you minister to them?

- Reread the church handbook chapters [Leadership and Councils in the Church of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title_number1) (4) and [Elders Quorum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng#title_number1) (8).

- Ask the Elders Quorum President or Bishop/Branch President what are some focus areas he would like you to train on.

- Set an appointment ahead of time.

- Ask the brother(s) to read the handbook chapters [Leadership and Councils in the Church of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title_number1) (4) and [Elders Quorum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng#title_number1) (8). ahead of time.


## During The Meeting
During the meeting, consider these suggestions.

- Make the experience a spiritual and positive experience.

- Start and end with prayer.
- Get to know the person or check on their family, work, and personal circumstances.


## Content
Consider these training topics.

**Leadership Structure**
> “The elders quorum president is directly responsible to the stake presidency… The elders quorum president also receives guidance from the bishop, who is the presiding officer in the ward.” HB 8.3.1

**Responsibilities**
The elders quorum president’s responsibilities are listed in [section 8.3.3.2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng#title_number11). The handbook states that “His counselors assist him.” How this work is divided among the presidency members is up to each presidency as they counsel together.

**Stake Initiatives**
The stake presidency has the following initiatives for Elders Quorum presidencies:

1. *Ministering Interviews*. Each Elders Quorum presidency is asked to set a ministering interview goal. The ministering interview should be an uplifting experience for the interviewer and the brother being interviewed.

2. *Temple*. Elders Quorum (and Relief Society) presidents are invited to choose a prospective Elder or a returning brother/sister who can set a goal to attend the temple for their endowments/sealing. He/she recommends this person to the stake president (and stake executive secretary), who will meet with the person and invite them in a loving way to set a goal to attend the temple with their family. EQ/RS presidents will then work with that person to achieve their goal.


## After The Meeting
After the training meeting, report back to the stake representative who requested the training assignment.

## Conclusion
Elders Quorum presidencies do an important work, as do all church callings, in helping Heavenly Father’s children. Stake leaders play an important part in instructing and supporting Elders Quorum presidencies in carrying out this important work.
