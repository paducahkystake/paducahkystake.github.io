High Councilors participate in several types of stake business. The table below summarizes these responsibilities. See the full details in the church handbook [chart of callings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng#title_number13).

Note: Although the “Set Apart By” column lists Stake presidency counselors or high councilors, the Stake President may also set apart people when others are not available.

Thanks for all you do!
