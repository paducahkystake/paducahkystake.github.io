> "The bishopric directs the work of the Church within the ward. As the executive secretary, you provide administrative support to members of the bishopric as they lead the ward and work with ward organizations." - [What Should I Focus On, Provide Administrative Support to the Bishopric](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/my-calling-as-an-executive-secretary/what-should-i-focus-on?lang=eng)

The executive secretary coordinates the work in the bishopric or branch presidency. They are vital to help keep ward/branch work organized and progressing. This article shares training resources for executive secretaries in the Paducah KY Stake. 

## Leadership Training
- Handbook chapters 1 - 4, especially [chapter 4: Leadership](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title_number2)
- [Handbook section 7.3: Executive Secretary](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/7?lang=eng#:~:text=see%2023.6.1.-,7.3,Ward,-Executive%20Secretary%20and)
- Integrity. Do what you commit to doing. Keep your word. This grows trust. 

## Paducah KY Training
In addition to the general church training above, here are some training topics specific to our stake. 

### ** Important Initiatives **
For 2026, one of our stake's focus areas is helping wards/branches increase the number of endowed members with active temple recommends. 

To do this, the stake executive secretary/clerk will review a list of recommend interview candidates with the ward/branch executive secretary. Where there isn't an executive secretary, the stake president will work directly with the Bishop/Branch President. 

Contact endowed members for temple recommend renewals in this order. 
1. Recommends expiring within 1 month
2. Recommends recently expired (1-3 months)
3. Recommends expiring in 1+ months
4. Recommends expired for a while

### General Tips
- Be considerate of the person you're engaging with. Try to put yourself in their shoes with each message or response you send. What would make them say the things they say? What might have happened during their day?
- Proofread. Re-read your message before sending it.
- Clarity. If you were the member receiving this message from the executive secretary, how would you feel and would the ask be clear? 
- Always say thank you. 

### Focus Duties
A few years ago, the Bishops/Branch presidents were asked which executive secretary duties (from the handbook) they needed the most. Here are the top 3 items. We invite you to ponder how this affects the way you serve and what areas you spend time on. We invite you to also discuss these items with your Bishop/Branch President to confirm in which areas he needs the most support.

1. Be Reliable. 
2. Be Proactive. In other words, don't wait to be asked to act. Ex: ask initially if it's ok to proactively set appointments based on the Action/Interview list, then go and do. Same for youth birthday list, etc. 
3. Be Present. Show up to leadership meetings. Bishop/Branch Presidency, Ward/branch council, etc

And here are the rest of the duties (in order of importance to the Bishops/Branch Presidents)

4. Be in the building during my interviews.
5. Prepare meeting agendas and follows up on action items
6. Be first point of contact to set appointments
7. Manage appointments on my calendar
8. Help with seminary and institute matters (registration, etc)
9. Knock on my door when my meeting is running long
10. Keep a list of members in the military and circulates to the ward/branch council

### How To Stay Organized
- Write things down, whether on paper or digitally. 
    > "The dullest pencil is better than the sharpest memory." - Unknown
- Use a shared calendar (digital if you can). Put the appointments on a calendar and set notifications. Digital (online) calendars are free ([Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), [Outlook Calendar](https://outlook.live.com/calendar), etc)
- If you have a lot of projects, initiatives, appointments, etc, use an organizational tool like [Trello](https://trello.com) or [Microsoft Planner](https://planner.cloud.microsoft.com).
- Plan. Review reports (action and interview, youth birthday, etc) monthly and set appointments ahead of time. 

### How To Initiate Contact
- Try to say hello in person before going to digital text messages, or email. This may not always be possible. 
- If you don't know the person and your text/email is the first communication, introduce yourself. Example: `"Hi, Sister X, I'm ___, the ward executive secretary. Bishop asked ..."`
- Start with a greeting, `Hi`, `Hello`, `Good morning/evening`; don't just go straight into the ask. 
- When speaking in person, say something genuine to break the ice. Don't go right into asking for something. 
    - `"How is your family?"`
    - `"I saw Jake (their son) hit a good basket at the bastketball game on Saturday..."` 

### What To Say To Be Welcoming
- Say hello at church (without asking for anything)
- Give before you ask. Ex: `"I remember your coconut pie at the pot lock was sooo good!"`
- For new or returning members, tell them you are happy they are there. `"I hope you feel welcome here. We are happy you are here."`

### What To Do (and not do) When a Member Stops Responding To Your Messages
- Don't keep trying the same way. Ex repeated text or repeated calls. This might be seen as badgering or annoying and could push people away. 
- Try a different way of contacting the person. Go from text to email, or phone call to in-person. 

### Examples 
A few examples of invitation messages:  

> "Hi, Sister X, hope you're well. Bishop is asking to meet with you. Can you meet at 12p today?"


> "Hi, Brother Y, it was good to see you at church. Bishop asked me to check in with you (and all the members of our ward). Our records show your recommend may be expiring soon? Can I help you schedule a renewal?"

(with introduction:) 
> "Hi Sister Z, I'm ___, the ward executive secretary. I really enjoyed your talk on Sunday. Bishop is trying to meet with members for tithing declaration and he asked me to reach out. Are you available on Sunday at 12:15p?"

## Conclusion
By following these tips, you will be a more effective executive secretary to reach people and help them progress toward their next ordinance.
