[Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) is essential to staying organized and with many events to keep up with, having email notifications of new events when using a shared calendar can be very useful. In this post, I describe how to enable this setting in Google Calendar.

## Settings
Follow the instructions below to enable a setting to be notified of new events and to get a daily email agenda of upcoming events.

1. Login to Google Calendar

2. Choose the Kebab menu option (three vertical dots) next to the shared calendar for which you wish to receive notifications. Shared calendars are listed in the left pane (if you’re logged in to a web browser). A settings page will open.

3. Scroll down to the “Other Notifications” section and change the options to “Email” next to each of the categories shown: New events, Changed events, Canceled events, and Event responses.

4. (Optional) If you wish to receive a daily agenda of upcoming meetings on the shared calendar, also choose “Email” on the “Daily agenda” item. I recommend this for busy individuals who don’t have time to check their calendar each morning.

## Conclusion
In this post, I’ve shown you how to enable email reminders on a shared Google calendar. Good luck and happy meetings!
