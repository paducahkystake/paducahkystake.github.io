In the Paducah KY stake, [High councilors](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/6-stake-leadership?lang=eng#title_number19) are asked to speak monthly in wards/branches. The stake presidency, after prayerful consideration, chooses the speaking topics from [General Conference](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference?lang=eng) talks. Follow the steps below to give a high council talk.

1. **Communicate**. Contact the assigned unit leader with **as much lead time as possible**, typically a few weeks in advance where possible. Introduce yourself and tell them your speaking topic. If you need to cancel, notify the unit of any change in your plans so the Bishops/Branch presidents can find a replacement speaker in time.

2. **Coordinate**. Work with the Bishop/Branch President to choose which Sunday is best for your visit. Most High Councilors choose 3rd Sundays but *it can be any Sunday that month.*

3. **Prepare spiritually**. Prayerfully consider what the people in that ward/branch need. Ask the Lord for help to deliver the message they need.

4. **Represent the stake presidency**. You represent the stake presidency. In your talk, tell the audience (and show them through your Christlike behavior) that the stake presidency sends their love for them.

5. **Make the message your own**. If you are given a general conference talk or scriptures as reference material, don’t just read them but write your own talk and use quotes or scriptures from the general conference message in your own talk.
