> *Updated: June 19, 2025. Added Huddle meetings*

In the Paducah Kentucky stake, we will:

### Empower the member/missionary coordination meeting:
- Have the right people at the coordination meeting:
EQ/RS counselor assigned to missionary work, Youth (YM/YW) assigned to missionary work, Ward/Branch Mission Leader (if called), Full time missionaries, Ward/branch Missionaries
- Use an agenda
- Use effective communication:
Notify Ward/Branch council of people to meet the Bishop, needed callings/ministering assignments, needed priesthood
- Review the covenant path report (previously called the new and returning member progress report)
- EQ/RS presidents submit a weekly return and report that includes a focus on new members
- Full-time missionaries submit a weekly member/missionary participation report
- The Stake presidency provides training

### Help Units have effective huddle meetings
- Huddle meetings are short meetings held to coordinate who will minister to those not present at church
- See [Weekly Coordination Meetings](https://northamericase.churchofjesuschrist.org/the-huddle?lang=eng-nase) for more details

### Make sacrament meeting a welcoming place

### Invite members to participate in half the appointments with missionaries (50% participation rate)

### Help unbaptized children (8+, area focus)
